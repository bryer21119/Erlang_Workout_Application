# Overview

I am currently trying to advance my understanding and knowledge of different programming languages. I tried out Erlang for this project and I found that it is a lot more difficult to understand that I thought it would be. 

I am trying to build an application that will track progress of working out throughout the week and have it log the information.

The purpose of writing this software was to gain a better understanding of Erlang and to see if I could build an application that would benefit others and myself when they decide to work out. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used youtube videos as well as a ton of other websites to help me produce what I currently have. I would like to study this language more in the future.

I decided to use erlang for this project and the library I used for it was -include_lib("stdlib/include/qlc.hrl").
I believe that is a library at least. I am not super familiar with erlang.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I need to fix the program by adding more code to it.
* I could improve the code by making it shorter in some areas
* I could make it have more features that it currently has.
